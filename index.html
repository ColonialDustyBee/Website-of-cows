                <p>This right here is a highland calf, a cow that is found in Scotland mainly but is also in other
                    parts of rural Europe, isn't it adorable? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While these cows don't produce any milk and are mainly used for meat, these are still inherently much better cows
                    than their bovine brethren due to their much more loyal nature.

                    They've even been known to have a similar personality to that of a labrador retriever with their friendly nature!
