                <li>Highland cattle originated from the highlands in Scotland</li>
                <li>They spend most of their day eating and can eat about 70kg or 154.32 lbs. If we wanna put that into consideration that's like eating about 77 Large pizzas in one day </li>
                <li>While they originated from scotland they can now be found across the globe, with some </li>
                <li>These are probably some of the few animals that have few to no conflicts amongst each other.</li>
                <li>They are known for their milk that is often used to make butter and more often than not they are used for their meat. Although why you'd want to eat this is baffling to me</li>
                <li>These cows have a relatively long lifespan with the maximum lifespan of 22 years</li>
                <li>They actually come in different colors besides brown! These come red, yellow, silver, white, and even black!</li>

            <h3>Here are some fun facts about them!</h3>
        </div>
        <div class = "main">
            <ul>
                <li>These cows actually made a guest appearance in the popular game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim where you could find them pretty much anywhere where there was civilization within the game</li>
                <img src = "images/skyrimHighlandCow.png" alt = "Highland Skyrim Cow" width = "500" length = "500">
                <li>Another bonus miscellaneous fact, these cows if killed in the game which you can do, will result in the entire town turning against you and attempt to murder you. Seriously, I've tried it when playing the game the first time and got murdered. It was definitely a treat</li>
                <li>A group of highland cows is known as a 'fold' or most commonly a 'herd'</li>
                <li>When a highland cow befriends another, they lick each other to show affection and have even been seen play fighting amongst each other</li>
                <li>These cattle can reach a running speed of 40km/h. That's 25 miles per hour and a little slower than Usain Bolt's top speed of 45km/h</li>
                <li>Finally the most important fact, these cows are: <h1>ADORABLE!</h1></li>
